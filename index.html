                        Story Time!!

                    Long ago in Italy there lived on old clock-maker named Geppetto. Tick-tick-TOCK! Tick-tick-TOCK! went all the clocks in his shop. When 
                    he worked, Geppetto felt happy. But when he rested, a sad feeling came over him. “Ah!” he would think. “All my life and no child to call my own!”  So,
                    one day Geppetto carved a puppet from wood in the shape of a boy.Pinocchio Boy Made of WoodThanks to Ramin, 8, Bangladesh
                    He made the arms and legs of the puppet so they could move. He cut and sewed a nice outfit for it, as if it were a real boy. "I will call you Pinocchio,"
                     said Geppetto.  That night, Geppetto lay the wooden puppet down onto the bed.  
                        From out of the window, a big star twinkled bright.  Geppetto looked out the window to the twinkling star.  
                        “Bright star,” said Geppetto. “If I could make one wish, it would be for a real boy of my own.” But of course, he knew that was not possible.
                        That night, the same big star swooshed right into Geppetto’s room. It changed into a Blue Fairy!  The Blue Fairy flew over to the bed.
                        “Little wooden puppet,” said the Blue Fairy. “In the morning, you will be able to walk and talk like a real boy.” She tapped the puppet one time with her wand. “And if someday you can prove that you are brave and true, you may become a real boy.”          
                        Pinocchio’s eyes opened.
                        Pinocchio and the Blue Fairy Wand  
                        “One more thing,” said the Blue Fairy. Suddenly. a cricket appeared. He was dressed mighty fine -and could talk! “Meet the Cricket", said the Blue Fairy. He will stay with you to help you make wise choices.”

                        And with that, the Blue Fairy went swoosh and was gone! Out of the window and up into the night sky.           
                        When Geppetto woke up the next morning, he said, “I will go take my puppet out of bed.” But the bed was empty! 
                        “Here I am, Father!” said Pinocchio from the other side of the room.
                        Geppetto swung around. “What? You can talk?”        
                        “Yep! I am Pinocchio, your boy!”   
                        “How can this be?” said Geppetto in shock. Then he said, “But who cares?” He rushed over and swept the wooden puppet into his arms. “Pinocchio, my son!” he said in great happiness.
                        Off to School        
                        One day Pinocchio said, “I want to go to school, like other boys.”
                        “Of course,” said Geppetto. But he did not have the money to buy schoolbooks.
                        Later that day, Geppetto came back home with schoolbooks. “Now you can go to school,” he said.
                        “But Father, where is your warm coat?”
                        With a wave of his hand Geppetto said, “No need to worry about that. What matters is that you will go to school tomorrow!” He did not want Pinocchio to know he had traded his warm coat to buy the schoolbooks.   
                        The next morning, Pinocchio said good-bye to Geppetto.

                        Thanks to Ava, 13, NC   
                        He skipped along the path to school, humming as he went. The Cricket rode on his shoulder, happy, too.     
                        Coming up to them on the path was a Fox and a Cat.      
                        “And where are you going on this fine day?” said the Fox.        
                        “I am going to school!” said Pinocchio.       
                        “On such a fine day as this?” said the Fox. “It is too nice to be stuck inside school! You should come with us, to the fair.”       
                        “Listen to me,” said the Fox. He put his arm around Pinocchio’s shoulder. “Anything you need to know, you can learn at the fair.”           
                        Thanks to Ali, 11, Iran          
                        “Really?” said Pinocchio.       
                        “Take it from me,” said the Fox.        
                        “Pinocchio!" said the Cricket.  "He does not know what he is talking about!”       
                        The Fox covered the Cricket with his hat. No one could hear the little fellow as the Cricket tried to call out, “Pinocchio, do not listen to him!”       
                        “Okay!” said Pinocchio. "Let's go to the fair!" And off they went.       
                        The Fair              
                        What a fair it was! By the gate was a man dressed in white. He called out, “Come in, come in! Right this way! Get your tickets here!”           
                        With a sad look Pinocchio said to the Fox and Cat, “I do not have any tickets.”       
                        A man was selling old things at a table near the gate. He called, “Hey, you! Sell me those new schoolbooks of yours! That is how you can get money for tickets.”     
                        The fair was so bright and colorful and exciting, that the next thing Pinocchio knew he had sold his schoolbooks for tickets.               
                        “No, Pinocchio, stop!” called the Cricket, who finally got out from under the Fox’s hat. But Pinocchio, the Fox and the Cat did not hear him. They were already inside the fair.      
                        The Man Who Ran the Fair     
                        On stage was a puppet show! “I am a puppet, too!" said Pinocchio.  "I can dance like that!” He jumped right onto the stage and started to dance with the other puppets.         
                        “Look at that new puppet!” someone called. “It has no strings!”         
                        Thanks to Shrijan, 7, UK    
                        “No strings?” said another. “Amazing!”
                        
                        Everyone laughed and laughed. They threw coins on the stage.
                        
                        The man who ran the fair saw coins fly onto the stage. “Well, now!” he said, rubbing his chin. “This puppet with no strings will make me rich!”
                        
                        The next thing Pinocchio knew, he was picked up and thrown in a birdcage. In the next moment, the door was locked shut.
                        
                        
                        Thanks to Siyona, 11, UK
                        
                         
                        
                        “Hey, get me out!” called Pinocchio. But the person who had thrown him in just left the room. Only the Cricket heard Pinocchio's calls. The Cricket ran back and forth, in and out of the birdcage, trying to find a way to free the lock.  But he could not unlock it.
                        
                        “I am stuck!” cried Pinocchio. "How did this happen to me?"
                        
                        The Nose Grows
                        
                        All of a sudden, poof! There was the Blue Fairy.
                        
                        “Please!” said Pinocchio. “Can you help me?”
                        
                        “Tell me something first,” said the Blue Fairy. “How did you get inside that cage?”
                        
                        “Tell her what happened,” said the Cricket.
                        
                        Could he really tell the Blue Fairy what had happened? What would she think of him?
                        
                        “Um, I was robbed,” said Pinocchio.
                        
                        “Is that right?” said the Blue Fairy with a frown. Pinocchio’s nose began to grow.
                        
                        “Yes, robbed!” said Pinocchio. “By two mean men – no, four!”
                        
                        The nose grew more.
                        
                        “They took my books. They made me come here.  And they threw me into this cage!”
                        
                        His nose grew longer and longer. Until Pinocchio could see nothing in front of his face but one big giant nose.
                        
                        “Why is my nose so big?” Pinocchio cried out.
                        
                        “Pinocchio!” said the Blue Fairy in a stern voice. “You must know what the truth really is.”
                        
                        Pinocchio and the Blue Fairy
                        Thanks to Ava,13, NC    
                        “I guess so,” said Pinocchio. “I wanted to come to the fair.  I came here with a Fox and the Cat.”
                        
                        The nose grew shorter.
                        
                        “I had to sell my books to get some tickets.”
                        
                        “Had to?” said the Blue Fairy.
                        
                        “I mean, I decided to sell my books to get tickets,” he said.
                        
                        The nose got shorter still.
                        
                        “Then someone put me in this cage,” he said.
                        
                        The nose was back to normal. “Good job, Pinocchio!” said the Cricket.
                        
                        “Well done,” said the Blue Fairy. “Now I will get you out of here.”
                        
                        With a wave of her wand, Pinocchio was out of the cage.
                        
                        “Here are your books.” And Pinocchio was holding the same new schoolbooks in his hands again.
                        
                        “Know this,” said the Blue Fairy, “you are on your own from now on. Make sure you do the right thing next time.” And she was gone.      
                        The Coachman
                        
                        Pinocchio was back on the road to school.  A Coachman drove up. “Hey kid, how about a ride?”
                        
                        “No, thank you,” said Pinocchio. “I am going to school.”
                        
                        “You will ride faster with me,” said the Coachman to Pinocchio. He said to himself, “He will ride faster all right, but not to where he thinks he is going!”
                        
                        "Alright," said Pinocchio. "I want to get to school right away!" 
                        
                        When Pinocchio was inside the coach, the Coachman said, “Say kid, why do you think boys like you go to school?”
                        
                        “To learn things,” said Pinocchio. “And to grow up, I guess.  So we can do what we want.”
                        
                        “Well,” said the Coachman, “what if I told you that could do what you wanted, right now?”
                        
                        “Right now?”
                        
                        “Yep! Think of it. Skip the books. Skip the school. Right now, how would you like to have all the candy you can eat!"
                        
                        "All the candy?"
                        
                        "Yep.  Ice cream, too.  Of every flavor. Ever want to smoke a cigar or play pool? All this and more, at Pleasure Island.”
                        
                        “Pleasure Island?”
                        
                        “Best place in the world for boys like you!”
                        
                        “Don’t listen to him, Pinocchio!” shouted the Cricket.
                        
                        “Why wait?” said the Coachman. “I know just where Pleasure Island is. This is your lucky day, kid. So what do you say?”
                        
                        “Let’s go there!” said Pinocchio. “I’m going to Pleasure Island!”
                        
                        “Augh!” said the Cricket, waving his arms in the air.
                        Pleasure Island     
                        After a while, the coach stopped.  “You got a boy with you in that coach?” said a dark stranger to the Coachman.
                        
                        “Yep.” The Coachman grabbed Pinocchio and threw him down onto the ground. “He’s all yours. Now pay up.” 
                        The Coachman reached out for something (was it money?) from the dark stranger. Then the Coachman drove off.
                        
                        What could it all mean? But as Pinocchio looked around, he no longer cared.
                        
                        For everything the Coachman had told him was true! Heaps of candy all about. Tubs of ice cream in every flavor. Boys like him could eat and eat, and play all day.  None of them had to work or clean up. There were even cigars if you wanted one, and pool tables to play.
                        
                        But after a few days, something was odd. “Where did all the boys go?” he asked the Cricket.
                        
                        “All I see now are donkeys,” said Pinocchio.
                        
                        “I must say, there used to be more boys around here,” said the Cricket.
                        
                        Just then, one of his ears popped into a donkey ear.  Then his other ear popped into a donkey ear, too.
                        
                        “Oh!” cried the Cricket. “What is happening to you?”
                        
                        “I don’t know - HONK!” said Pinocchio.

                        Pinocchio and the Cricket saw a line of donkeys led by a dark stranger onto a truck. “Oh, no!” said the Cricket. “Now I get it! Boys get turned into donkeys here. Then the donkeys are sold! Pinocchio, we have to get you out of here, fast - while we still can!”
                        
                        “Let’s go – HONK!” said Pinocchio. His two feet had popped into four.
                        
                        “Run, quick!” said the Cricket. One good thing about Pinocchio’s new four legs is he could run very fast! Quick, quick, they ran out of Pleasure Island. Soon they were at a dock by the ocean.
                        
                        “Please sir!” Pinocchio called out to a man by the dock. “I am looking for an old man named Geppetto. Do you know him? – HONK!”
                        
                        “Sounds like you are getting a bad cold,” said the man. “Hmm, Geppetto. That’s the old man whose son left one morning and did not come back. He went out on a boat to look for him. No one has seen the poor fellow since.”
                        
                        “Oh no! This is all my fault – HONK!” said Pinocchio. “I must look for my father!” Pinocchio jumped off of the dock into the ocean. The Cricket jumped in too, close behind.
                        
                         
                        
                        The Whale
                        
                        Most of Pinocchio was still made of wood, so he could float on the ocean. “Father!” he called out, paddling the water with his arms. “Father!” but there was no answer.
                        
                        All Pinocchio could see around him was blue water, everywhere. Until – what was that, far away? Something was rushing up. Something big, and very fast!
                        
                        Monstro
                        Thanks to Ava, 13, NC
                        
                         
                        
                        In a moment, a giant whale was upon them. It opened its giant jaws and with one gulp, swallowed Pinocchio! Rushing inside with all the sea water tumbled Pinocchio and the Cricket. When they came to a stop, they saw that they were in the dark belly of the whale.
                        
                        “Are you okay?” said Pinocchio to the Cricket.
                        
                        “I am fine,” said a voice of an old man.
                        
                        “Wait a minute,” said Pinocchio. “Father, is that you?”
                        
                        There was Geppetto!
                        
                        “Father, Father, it’s me!” said Pinocchio.
                        
                        “My son!” said Geppetto. “I thought I was dreaming!”
                        
                        They hugged in joy.
                        
                        “Look!” said Geppetto as three fish swam by. “There goes our dinner!”
                        
                        “Father, I have an idea! Let’s make a fire.”
                        
                        “Grilled fish tonight!” said Geppetto.
                        
                        “No, I mean for us to get out!” said Pinocchio. He gathered driftwood and got a flame going. “This is how we can make the whale sneeze!” he said. Pinocchio waved his arms over the flame to make a lot of smoke. Soon, clouds of black smoke were rising up.
                        
                        The whale gave a cough. “Hang on!” said Pinocchio. And then… WHAM!! In one big sneeze, Pinocchio, Geppetto and the Cricket flew out of the whale’s mouth. Rolling over and over in the sea water, at last they rolled up onto the shore.
                        
                        “Pinocchio?” Geppetto rose to his feet. The Cricket was there beside him.  But where was Pinocchio?
                        
                        And then they found him! Pinocchio was face down, his head in a puddle.
                        
                        “Pinocchio!”
                        
                        They were too late. Geppetto and the Cricket wept over Pinocchio, the boy puppet, who lay still in the water.
                        
                        Then in a flash, who was there but the Blue Fairy!
                        
                        “Pinocchio,” she said. “You saved your father. You proved that you are both brave and true.” She tapped his head with her wand. “And now you will be a real boy.”
                        
                        Pinocchio woke up.  He looked at his soft arms and soft legs.
                        
                        “Father!” he cried out. “Look! I am a real boy!”
                        
                        “That you are!” cried Geppetto.
                        
                        The Blue Fairy turned to the Cricket. “Come,” she said. In a flash, the two of them were gone.
                        
                        And they lived many long and happy years together.
                        
                        The end.

               Story Time!!

                Once upon a time, a princess named Snow White lived in a castle with her father, the King, and her stepmother, the Queen. Her father had always said to his daughter that she must be fair to everyone at court. Said he, “People come here to the castle when they have a problem. They need the ruler to make a fair decision. Nothing is more important than to be fair.”

                The Queen, Snow White’s stepmother, knew how much this meant to her husband. At the first chance, she went to her magic mirror.  “Mirror, mirror, on the wall,” said the Queen.  “Who is the fairest of them all?”
                
                 
                
                Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
                 
                
                “Snow White is the fairest of them all!” said the Magic Mirror.
                
                 “What?!” yelled the Queen.  “No one is more fair than I!  The Queen must have the best of everything - everyone knows that.  What could be more fair than that?”
                
                “Snow White is the fairest of them all!” repeated the Magic Mirror.
                
                 “What do you know – you’re a mirror!” roared the Queen.  And she stormed off. 
                
                Still, the Queen was bothered.  So bothered was she that the Queen decided to be rid of the girl, once and for all. 
                
                “I cannot wait another day!” she declared.  The Queen called for her servant, a huntsman.  “Find a reason to take Snow White deep into the woods,” she said, pointing her long finger at the servant. “Then kill her.”
                
                The huntsman was shocked!  But she was the Queen and what could he do?  The next day he took Snow White into the woods.  As he drew his knife to slay her, Snow White turned around.
                
                 
                
                Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
                 
                
                “Look,” she said, taking something out of her pocket.  “You have always been good to me.”  She held in front of him six perfect arrowheads that she had carefully shaped. “Do you like them?” she said.  “They are for you.”
                
                “Snow White,” said the huntsman.  “I cannot do this!”
                
                “You can take these,” said Snow White.
                
                "That's not what I mean," said the servant.  He dropped to his knees.  “How can I say this to you?  The Queen, your step-mother, ordered me to kill you,” he said.  “But I cannot!”
                
                “She did what?” Snow White called out with alarm.
                
                “You must run away!” said the huntsman.  “Far into the woods.  Now!  And never come back to the castle!”
                
                Snow White turned and ran into the woods as fast as she could.  Deeper and deeper she ran.  It was getting dark, and the wolves were starting to howl.  She tripped and her skirt was torn.  Tall tree branches seemed to reach down to the very ground to grab her.  She was scratched, bleeding and scared.  Yet she ran on and on.
                
                Then all of a sudden, far away, there was a light.  Who was living so deep in the woods?  She stepped up closer.  It was a cottage!  Yet no sound came from the cottage, only light from the windows.
                
                 
                
                Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
                 
                
                “Hello?” she said, knocking softly on the door.  “Hello?” No answer.  The door was a little bit open.  She opened it some more and stepped in.  “Hello, is anyone home?” 
                
                She looked around.  What a mess!  She had never seen a messier living room.
                
                “This cottage may be the biggest mess I ever saw,” she thought.  “But it's a roof over my head for tonight. Maybe if I clean up around here, I can earn my sleep.”
                
                As she cleaned, she thought of someone she already missed.  Before her father had re-married, she and a Prince who lived in the next kingdom were getting to know each other.  They would take long walks in the royal garden and tell each other stories, and laugh.
                
                 
                
                Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
                 
                
                After the Queen had moved into the castle, her stepmother had made a new rule – no more visitors.  Now the Prince had to slip over the palace gate in secret. He would call out to her from under her window and they could talk a bit that way. It wasn’t as good as the long walks but it was the best they could manage.  
                
                Now that she had to run away from home, would she ever see him again?
                
                After Snow White cleaned up the living room, she went upstairs.  On the second floor, there were seven little beds lined up in a row, as if for children.  Tired from cleaning, Snow White yawned and lay across all seven of the beds.  Soon she fell fast asleep.
                
                In the meantime, the Seven Dwarfs were heading home from a long day of working in the jewel mines.  When they opened the door, you can imagine their surprise when they saw their cottage all cleaned up!
                
                “What kind of magic is this?” said one of the Dwarfs, whose name was Doc.
                
                “I wouldn’t mind more magic like this!” said another of the Dwarfs with a smile.  His name was Dopey.
                
                “We'd better check upstairs,” said another Dwarf, whose name was Grumpy.  “Something is fishy around here, that’s for sure.”
                
                There – lying across all their beds, was a young lady, fast asleep. 
                
                “Who are you?” said all the Dwarfs at once. 
                
                 
                
                Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
                 
                
                Snow White bolted awake.  The Seven Dwarfs could tell she was as surprised as they were.  Soon they all relaxed and shared their stories. 
                
                Snow White learned their names – Bashful, Doc, Dopey, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, and Sneezy. She told them all about her step-mother.  That her stepmother had tried to get the huntsman to kill her, that the huntsman had set her free in the woods, and that she could never go back home again.
                
                “Stay here, with us,” said Bashful. 
                
                “That’s sweet,” said Snow White.  “But if I were to stay here at your home, I would have to do something for all of you.”
                
                “You already cleaned up our place,” said Sneezy. 
                
                “Keeping the house clean will be easy,” said Snow White, “as long as we all pitch in.  I will let everyone know what part they can do, and I will do my share too, of course.”
                
                “That’s fair,” said Happy.
                
                “But there must be something else I can do for you,” said Snow White.
                
                The Seven Dwarfs shrugged.
                
                “Do you know how to read?” said Doc.  "We have these books filled with wonderful tales and would love to be able to read them." And so it was agreed that Snow White would give them reading lessons.   
                
                 
                
                Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
                 
                
                To celebrate their new friendship, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs sang and danced the night away. 
                
                The next morning before they left for work, the Seven Dwarfs warned Snow White she must not open the door to anyone.  After all, who knows what evil her stepmother might do?  The princess nodded in agreement, and the Dwarfs left the house.  The princess prepared her first reading lesson. She also prepared a good hot meal for the Seven Dwarfs when they returned home that night.  And so the days passed.
                
                Back at the castle, the Queen marched up to her mirror.  “Mirror, mirror on the wall," she demanded.  "Who is the fairest of them all?”
                
                “Snow White is the fairest of them all!” said the Magic Mirror.
                
                 
                
                Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
                 
                
                “That’s impossible!” screamed the Queen.  “The girl is no longer alive!”
                
                “Snow White lives!” said the Magic Mirror.  And an image was shown on the mirror of Snow White living in the cottage of the Seven Dwarfs.
                
                The Queen turned red with rage.  She screamed, “She will not get away with this!”
                
                At the cottage of the Dwarfs the next afternoon, when the Seven Dwarfs were away at work, there was a knock on the door.
                
                “Who is it?” said Snow White.  She remembered the warning of the Seven Dwarfs not to open the door to anyone.
                
                “It’s only a poor old woman,” came a squeaky voice, “selling apples.” Yet it was the evil Queen, disguised as an old woman.  “It’s raining out here, my dear,” said her voice through the door.  “Please let me in.”
                
                “Poor thing," thought Snow White, "having to go door to door selling apples in the rain."  And so she opened the door.
                
                “Take a look at this big red apple,” said the old woman, who as you know by now was really the Queen in disguise. She held the red apple close to Snow White’s face.  “Lovely, my dear, isn’t it?”
                
                 
                
                Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
                 
                
                “I would like very much to buy your apple,” said Snow White. “But I have no money.”
                
                “That fine comb in your hair will make a good trade,” said the old woman.
                
                “Well, all right then!” said Snow White.  She took the comb out of her hair and gave it to the old woman, who then gave her the apple.  Snow White took a big bite.  Alas, the fruit was poisoned!  At once, Snow White fell to the ground in a deep sleep. 
                
                “YES!” shouted the Queen, pumping the air with her fists. 
                
                Just then the door flew open.  In marched the Seven Dwarfs, home from the day's work.  Shocked indeed they were to find Snow White lying on the floor and what must be her stepmother beside her, laughing!
                
                They chased that evil Queen out the door, and into the storm.  Up to the very top of a mountain they chased her.  All of a sudden, lightning hit the mountain!  The Queen fell, and she was never seen again.
                
                But there was nothing to help poor Snow White.  She stayed absolutely still in her deep sleep.  The Seven Dwarfs gently lifted her into a glass coffin.  Day and night they kept watch over her.
                
                One day, the Prince happened to pass through.  Ever since he had learned that Snow White was missing at the castle, he was searching for her, far and wide.  Now he had finally found her, but in such a state! The Prince pulled open the glass coffin.  Her face seemed so fresh, even in that deep sleep. 
                
                 
                
                Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
                 
                
                He gently took one of Snow White's hands in his own and kissed it.  At once, Snow White’s eyes opened!  With Love's First Kiss, the evil Queen's spell was forever gone. Now nothing stood in the way for Snow White and the Prince to be together forever.  They returned to the kingdom and lived happily ever after.
         
                The end!!

                 story Time !!
                One day Maui said to his four brothers, “Come fishing with me today!  Let’s go far out to sea. The fish are much bigger and better there, than they are close to land.”  

                “Okay!” said his brothers.  They were good fishermen and wanted those big fish.  The four brothers and Maui jumped into their canoe and started to row.  When they got far out to sea and could no longer see land, Maui jumped onto the end of the canoe.  He drew out his magical fishing hook. When his brothers were looking ahead, he cast the hook over the side of the canoe.  The hook sunk down deep into the blue water.

                Soon, the magical hook stuck fast to the bottom of the sea. Maui pulled the fishing line tight. He called out, “See that tug? I must have hooked a giant fish!”
                
                “Wow, I see that!” said one brother. 
                
                "That is some fish you caught!" said another.
                
                “My brothers!” Maui called out.  “Paddle hard so we can bring up this great fish!”
                
                The brothers paddled with all their might.  They paddled so hard they did not see that the hook was pulling up the land from the bottom of the sea.  Behind them, one island after another rose from the sea!
                
                Legend says that is how Maui made the islands, where the people now live.

                Maui Catches the Sun
                
                One day, Maui wanted to see how life was for the people who lived on the islands.  But what he saw there made his heart skip a beat. Life was very hard for them. And he could see why - the days were just too short!  There was not time in a day for people to do what they needed to do, like making and cooking food. If they laid out a wet blanket on the sand, the blanket would still be wet the next day.  There was not even time for the fruit in the trees to get ripe.
                
                “It is that Sun!” said Maui.  “He is racing too fast across the sky!  He is not thinking about the people who live down below, on the islands.”  
                
                
                Thanks to Lisa, 6, GA USA
                
                 
                
                Maui knew it was up to him, a demi-god, to slow down the Sun. But how?  He asked his brothers. He asked his sister Hina. He asked still others that he knew.  
                
                “Who do you think you are, Maui?” said one.  “No one can catch the Sun!”
                
                “Even if you are a demi-god,” said another, “you know very well the Sun is too big and bright for anyone to stop.”
                
                But Maui’s sister Hina did not say these sorts of things.  She cut off her long hair.  She tied the hair into ropes and gave the ropes to Maui.  From those ropes, Maui made a giant lasso.  
                
                That night, Maui took his lasso up to the very tallest mountain on the islands of Hawaii.  The mountain had once been an active volcano. Years ago it had sent out waves of hot lava.  When the volcano was over, a big crater was left at the top of the mountain.  And that crater is where Maui planned to catch the Sun.
                
                By the crater Maui waited, very still.  He hid the lasso behind him, out of view. When the Sun rose at dawn, it started to race across the sky very fast.  Soon that Sun was flying over the mountaintop. Brave Maui flung the lasso over his head. The ropes caught!  The Sun tried and tried to move, but was trapped!

                “Get me out of here!” shouted the Sun.
                
                “Not yet!” said Maui.  “You are moving too fast across the sky.  It makes the days too short for the humans who live down below.”
                
                “So I like to go fast!” said the Sun.  “Who cares? Let me out of here!”
                
                “No!” said Maui in a big voice.  “I care! You have to stay here, in this crater!”  He pulled the lasso tight. But in his heart, Maui did not feel brave.  He did not know how much longer he could hold on. True, his lasso was stronger than any other rope in all the land.  But he did not know how long even a lasso made from his sister’s hair could last before the hot rays of the Sun would burn it up.  
                
                maui 
                Thanks to Aron, 8, India
                
                 
                
                The Sun tried to move again, but could not.  “Oh, very well!” the Sun said, at last. You can be sure Maui was very glad to hear that!  “I suppose I could slow down a little," said the Sun. "But only for part of the year.”
                
                So Maui and the Sun worked out a deal.  For half the year, the Sun would move at a slow pace.  Those days would be long, and that would be the summer. For the other half of the year, the sun could run as fast as it wanted to do.  Those days would be short, and that would be the winter.
                
                This is how Maui made the days longer for the people of the islands.  At last, they could do the tasks they needed. They could have a full dinner and rest after.  And the fruits on the trees grew big and sweet. 
                
                The end

                 Story Time!!

                One day a deer was born.  His name was Bambi.  His mother washed him all over with her tongue.

                “Bambi,” she said.  “My little Bambi.”
                
                The young Bambi was curious about everything.  He learned he was a deer, and so was his mother.  He learned there are other deer in the forest, and someday he would meet them. He learned the trails his mother followed were made by the deer. Bugs and critters, sounds and smells. So many wonders to explore!
                
                 
                
                Bambi A Life in the Woods
                Thanks to Kaivalya, 9, NJ
                
                 
                
                Sometimes on a trail, suddenly his mother would stop still.  She would open her ears wide and listen from all directions. First- over there! Then- here!  Bambi would wait.  At last, when she said, “It’s all right.  There’s no danger. We can go,” then the two of them would start on the trail again.  But he did not know why they had to do this. 
                
                One day, his mother took him to the meadow for the first time.  He started to run out to the open clearing but she jumped right in front of him.  “Stop!” said she. “Stay here.  I must go out first. Wait till I call for you.  But if I start to run, you must turn around and run back into the woods very fast.  Do not stop.  Do you understand me?” 
                
                Bambi’s mother slowly stepped out into the open meadow.  She sniffed all around.  She looked this way and that, alert and carefully.  After awhile she said, “It’s fine, Bambi.  Nothing to worry about.  Come on!” He bounded out to meet her. 
                
                Oh, what a bright sun!  Back in the woods, Bambi had seen a stray sunbeam every now and then, but here the hot bright sun warmed him all over.  He felt marvelous and jumped high into the air.  Each time he landed on grass softer than any grass he had ever felt.  Then he leaped back up again, over and over.
                
                In some places the flowers were so thick, they made a sweet carpet.   But what was that tiny thing dancing in the air?  “Look, Mother!” said Bambi.  “The flower is flying.” Why, that flower must have needed to dance so much, Bambi thought, that it broke right off its stem to rise up and dance in the air.
                
                “That’s not a flower, Bambi,” said the mother, “it’s a butterfly.” 
                
                Then – Thump, thump, thump!  On a rock was a young hare, a rabbit, thumping its foot. 
                
                “Hello, there!” smiled Hare, raising one tall ear. “Want to play?”
                
                “Sure!” said Bambi. 
                
                “Catch me!”  Hare hopped off the rock into the grass, hop-hopping away. Bambi was a bit faster at running and jumping, but Hare was better at hiding, so the two of them had a fine time.

                On top of the flowers, a tall, fluffy black and white tail was sliding over to them.  “Why, I’d know that tail anywhere!” said Hare.  “It’s my friend Skunk.  He’s under the flowers.  Skunk?”  And sure enough, a black and white head popped up.
                
                “This is Bambi,” said Hare.  Soon the three of them were exploring the meadow, sniffing its rich deep smells.

                After awhile, Hare and Skunk had to go home.  Bambi looked around.  “Mother! Where are you?”  At the far side of the meadow he saw her, with a creature that looked just like her.
                
                “Bambi, come meet my sister Ena,” called Bambi’s mother.  “And her two little ones.”  Bambi hopped over.  Two fawns, little Faline and her brother Gobo, were running in and out of their mother’s legs.   
                
                Faline gave a leap and landed right in front of Bambi, then jumped back to Gobo.  With care, Bambi stepped up to her.  Faline hopped off to one side and Gobo followed.  Soon the three of them were chasing each other up and down the grass. 
                
                “Now run off and play, all of you,” said Bambi’s mother.
                
                Every day after that, the three young deer played and chattered.  They raced and chased, they nibbled many strawberries and blueberries on the bushes, and sometimes they just talked.
                
                One day, Bambi said, “Do you know what danger means?”
                
                “Something very bad,” whispered Gobo. 
                
                “But what is it?” said Bambi.
                
                “I know what danger is,” said Faline.  “It’s what you run away from.”  But soon they were chasing and playing again. 
                
                Bambi’s mother and Ena came up.  “Come on now,” they said. “It’s time to go home.”
                
                Far off at the top of a hill two large proud deer came into view, with enormous heads of antlers. 
                
                Turning to them, Faline said, “Who are they?”
                
                “Those are your fathers,” said Ena.
                
                “If you are smart and don’t run into danger,” said Bambi’s mother to her son, “someday you will grow up as big and handsome as your father. And you will have antlers, too.”  Bambi’s heart swelled with pride.
                
                As Bambi grew, he learned how to sniff the air.  He could tell if his friend Hare was coming, or if a fox had just trotted by.  He could tell if it would rain soon.
                
                One afternoon came a raging storm.  Lightning flashed and thunder crashed.  Bambi thought the end of the world had come.  But when he lay by his mother’s side, he felt safe.
                
                One day when Bambi wandered about in the woods, he came upon a sharp, unpleasant smell.  Curious, he followed it.  It led to a clearing, where stood a strange creature.  He had never seen such a creature.  It stood up on its rear legs, and in its two arms it held something long and black – could it be a third leg?  The smell of the creature somehow filled him with terror. The creature raised its long black arm.  In a flash, Bambi’s mother rushed up to him. 
                
                “Run, Bambi, run!  As fast as you can!” 
                
                Bambi's mother bounded over shrubs and bushes.  He kept pace beside her till they were back at their leafy home.
                
                Later, Bambi’s mother said, “Did you see the Human?”  Bambi nodded yes.  “That’s the one who brings danger,” she said.  And both of them shuddered.
                
                Bambi was still growing.  The first time he woke to find his mother gone from his side, he was scared.  It was early morning and still dark.  “Mother! Mother!” he called out. A large shadow approached, bigger than his mother’s.  Standing before a pool of moonlight, a Great Old Buck looked proud and stern.
                
                “Who are you calling?” said the Buck with a frown.  “Can’t you take care of yourself?”  Bambi did not dare answer. He lowered his head in shame.   “Look up,” said the Old Buck, “Listen to me.  Watch.  Smell.  Find out for yourself.  You will be fine on your own.”
                
                The leaves fell and Bambi grew even taller.

                His mother started leaving him alone more and more, letting him meet other deer and creatures of the forest. Faline, Gobo, Hare and Skunk were still Bambi’s best friends, but he also found other creatures fascinating to watch and sometimes fun to play with.
                
                One wet winter day, the terrible smell of Humans swept across the forest.  The scent was so strong that there had to be many Humans in a group! Most animals quickly fled out of danger.  But some were not as lucky.  With the hunter’s loud noise and great power, many animals were killed and one of them was Bambi’s mother.
                
                After that terrible day, Bambi felt lost.  He wandered about. How could this awful thing have happened?  Suddenly, the Great Old Buck stepped out in front of him. 
                
                “Were you out in the meadow when it happened?” the Old Buck said.
                
                “Yes,” said Bambi. 
                
                “And you’re not calling for your mother?” said the Buck.
                
                Suddenly Bambi felt full of courage.  “I can take care of myself!” he said, looking up.
                
                The Great Old Buck smiled.  “Listen to me,” he said.  “Smell.  Watch. Learn to live and be careful. Find out for yourself.  Now farewell.”  And he vanished into the deep forest. 
                
                 
                
                Bambi A Life in the Woods
                 
                
                Winter came.  Strong and bitter cold winds swept through the woods.  Deep snow covered the forest floor.  There was little food to eat.  Bambi felt hungry and cold all the time.  Nearly all the bark on the trees had been peeled away by hungry deer.  Still, the cold wind blistered on, day after day.
                
                Gobo had always been smaller than Bambi and Feline.  He shivered all the time.  He could hardly stand up anymore. 
                
                One day a flock of crows flew overhead, yelling loudly.  “Caw!  Caw!”  The geese also screamed in the sky, “Gawk! Gawk!” They warned of the Humans coming - again!
                
                Hare hopped up and down in alarm.  “We’re surrounded!  They are everywhere!” A single boom crashed like thunder, and one goose fell from the sky.  All the animals ran like mad, even the tiny tit mouse.  Another short crash like thunder, and a fox fell down on the forest floor.  Bang! Bang! 
                
                Hare called out to Bambi, “We have to get out of here!”  Bambi and Hare started to bound away.  But was that Gobo, lying in the snow?
                
                “Gobo!” said Bambi. “Where is your mother and Faline?”
                
                “I fell down,” said Gobo.  “I’m too weak.  You go on, Bambi.” 
                
                Another young deer bounded by.  “Bambi, run!  Don’t just stand there if you can run!”  He took off like the wind, and as Bambi ran along, he called behind him, “I will come back for you, Gobo!” Bambi ran and ran.  Soon the sound that boomed as loud as thunder grew more and more distant. 
                
                When Bambi returned to where Gobo had been, there was no trace of him, not even his tracks.  Just big tracks.  Faline and her mother were pacing around the spot.  “What has become of him?” wailed Ena.  But they all knew.  They could smell it. A Human had come and had taken Gobo away.
                
                Weeks passed. At last, little sprigs of fresh green grass popped up through the snow.  Then more and more tufts of green.  What was left of the snow melted away.  On Bambi’s head, he could feel the weight of his fast-growing antlers. 
                
                As the trees and bushes turned green and the weather warmed, all the animals started to act so oddly.  Birds flitted about two by two.  So many creatures large and small were in pairs.  His friend Skunk spent all his time was with a girl skunk and hardly noticed Bambi.  Even his friend Hare seemed in a daze, forever staring at a girl hare and thumping his foot.  
                
                “What’s happened to my friends?” said Bambi.  “I am alone.”  There was a rustling in the leaves behind him.  There stood Faline, but she was grown up now, like he was.  Each of them was thinking, “How different you look!”  They gazed at each other and smiled. 
                
                “It has been a long time since we saw each other,” said Faline. 
                
                “Yes, I know,” said Bambi.  They talked of old times.  “Do you remember playing Tag on the meadow?” said one.  “Do you remember all the berries on the bushes we ate?” said the other.  The two seemed to understand each other perfectly. 
                
                A fat deer came up to them, sniffing the air.
                
                “Sister, don’t you know me?” 
                
                Faline and Bambi turned in amazement.  “Gobo!”  They rushed up to him in joy. 
                
                “So you’re not dead!” said Bambi. 
                
                “Where have you been?” said Faline. 
                
                Gobo told his story.  “I was with a Human.  I have seen a lot more than the rest of you, all together.” Dogs had found him when he lay in the snow, and they barked.  The Human came and carried Gobo to the place where he lived.  “It was as warm as summer inside,” said Gobo.  “Rain may pour outside, but not inside where Humans live.  It is always dry and warm!  And there is always something to eat, too - turnips, hay, potatoes, carrots - yum!”
                
                 “Weren’t you afraid, though?” said Faline.
                
                “No, the Human wouldn’t hurt me.  If he loves you, or if you serve him, he’s good to you,” said Gobo.  “They all loved me there.  The children petted me.”
                
                The Great Old Buck strode out from the bushes.  “What kind of band is that you have on your neck?” 
                
                “It’s a halter I wear,” said Gobo.  “It’s a great honor to wear the Human’s halter.”
                
                “Be silent!” said the Great Old Buck.  “You poor thing.”  He turned and was gone.
                
                One day when Gobo and Bambi were together, they smelled the scent of a Human.  “We must hide, at once!” said Bambi.  “No need for that,” said Gobo.  “The Humans know me.” Then all at once a sharp bang!  And Gobo fell down. 
                
                Fortunately, the Human never came after Gobo.  Instead, when the scent of the Human went away, Bambi pulled his friend to a leafy place where he could rest and be out of danger.  Bambi knew what weeds his mother used to eat to heal a wound faster.  As he brought the weeds to Gobo, he wondered, “Why must this always happen to us?” Bambi thought of the Great Old Buck who had said, “Find out for yourself.” Find out what?
                
                Faline and Ena brought Gobo food and visited with him for hours. Bambi often came by, too, until Gobo was healed. The words from the Great Old Buck still fresh in his head – “Learn to live and be careful.” Bambi was starting to understand. 
                
                Seasons came and went.  Bambi grew still taller.  His antlers were nearly full grown now.  One day, Bambi caught a new warning smell in the air.  It was a hot and smoky smell.  A flock of crows rushed overhead, cawing loudly.  Fire! 
                
                At once, the animals were running, running, as fast as they could.  It wasn’t easy to run away from fire.  Sometimes it seemed to rush in from different directions.  After hours went by of flames and smoke, the fire started to wind down at last.  The smell of fire was fading, too. 
                
                The Great Old Buck stepped in front of Bambi. His head was gray now, but he still bore his antlers with pride.  “Come with me,” he said in a serious way.  “I want to show you something before I go.”
                
                 
                
                Bambi A Life in the Woods
                 
                
                He led Bambi through the woods to a burned-out village.  Mixed along with the smell of fire was the same awful smell of Humans that had sent terror to their hearts again and again.   
                
                “Do not be frightened,” said the Old Buck.  Closer and closer they went to the village.  “Look, Bambi,” he said.  There in front of them were dozens of huts.  Each one was burned, some almost to the ground, others burned mostly on the roof.  The village was empty. 
                
                “You see, Bambi,” said the Old Buck.  “The houses of the Humans get burned by fire just like the places where we stay in the woods.  The Human isn’t above us.  We are just the same. Do you understand me, Bambi?”
                
                “Fire burns the woods where we live, and it burns the villages of Humans, too,” said Bambi.  “We are not so different from Humans.”
                
                “We both live under the same great powers in this world,” said the Great Old Buck.
                
                “Yes,” said Bambi.
                
                “Now I can go,” said the Great Old Buck.  “Don’t follow me.  My time is up.  Goodbye my son, I loved you so.”
                
                Now Bambi had become a full Buck himself.  His antlers spiked and gleamed in the sun. 
                
                Sometimes he would visit the corner of the woods where he had spent his childhood.  Some of the trails were still there.  Once while wandering there he saw Gobo and his sister, Faline. When he saw Faline, his heart beat faster. He wanted to rush to her.  He gazed after her.  Finally she was gone.  Then he heard the call of two little fawns. 
                
                 “Mother!  Mother!” they called.
                
                “Can’t you stay by yourselves?” said Bambi.  The little brother and sister were too much in awe of the great Buck to answer. Bambi thought, this little fellow pleases me.  He reminds me of the deer face I used to see when I looked in the brook years ago. Perhaps I’ll meet him again.  The little girl is nice, too.  Faline looked like that once.
                
                “Listen to me,” said Bambi to the two fawns.  “You must watch and listen. Find out for yourself.  You will be fine on your own.”
            
                The end.

                Story Time!!
                Once upon a time, a young man’s father died.  Aladdin, as that was the young man’s name, took his father’s place in running the family store with his mother.  One day, a stranger walked into the store.

                “I am your uncle,” said the stranger to Aladdin.  “I have come to see you.”
                
                “But my father never spoke of a brother,” said Aladdin.
                
                Aladdin’s mother turned around. “My husband had no brother,” said she to the stranger, narrowing her eyes.
                
                “I assure you it is true,” said the stranger. “Years ago your husband and I agreed that if something should happen to him, since I have been very fortunate in my life, I would help to bring the same good fortune to your family.”
                
                The mother was interested.  “What do you have in mind?” she said.
                
                “I know of a secret place that holds many riches,” said the stranger.  “I will take your son. With the wealth he will find there, you and he will be set for life.”

                And so the mother agreed.  The old man and the boy traveled for days throughout the desert.  At last they came to a cave. “You must know that I learned a bit of magic in my life,” said the old man to Aladdin.  “Don’t be surprised by anything you might see.”
                
                They stepped inside the cave.  Pitch-black it was. The old man shook open his fist and a ball of light suddenly appeared, brightening the cave.  Under the light with one long finger, he drew the shape of a circle over the ground. He pulled from his pocket some red dust and threw it over the circle, and at the same time said some magic words.  The earth trembled a little before them. The floor of the cave cracked open, and the cracks grew wider and deeper. Then up from below the ground rose a giant white quartz crystal and it filled the circle. 
                
                “Do not be alarmed,” said the magician.  “Under this giant white crystal lies a treasure that is to be yours.”    
                
                He chanted a few magic words and the giant crystal rose up several feet in the air, moved to the side and landed.  Aladdin peered into the hole. He saw steps that led down to a dark hole.
                
                 “Fear nothing,” said the magician to Aladdin. “But obey me. Go down, and at the foot of the steps, follow a long hall.  You will walk through a garden of fruit trees. You must touch nothing of them. Walk on till you come to a large flat stone and on the stone will be a lighted lamp.  Pour out the oil in the lamp and bring it to me. Now go!”

                Aladdin slowly stepped down the stairs.  Through the garden of fruit trees and marvelous to behold, the trees held fruits that sparkled and shone. He could not help but reach out and touch one. 
                
                Then – too late – he remembered what his uncle had said. But nothing terrible happened. So he figured he might as well put the fine jewel-fruit in his vest pocket.  Then he plucked another and another jewel-fruit, till all his pockets were filled.
                
                Aladdin came to the large flat stone, and on it was a lighted lamp, just as his uncle had said.  He poured out the oil and took it back to the opening of the cave.

                Aladdin called out, “Here I am, Uncle!”
                
                The magician called out in a great hurry, “Give me the lamp!”
                
                “Just as soon as I’m up,” said Aladdin, wondering why the magician seemed in such a hurry.  
                
                “No, give me the lamp NOW!” cried the old man, reaching down his hand.  For you see, the only way the lamp could come out of the cave was as a gift, from one person to another. 
                
                The magician knew this, and he wanted to get the lamp from the boy as soon as he could, and then kill him.  Aladdin felt a chill in the air. Something was wrong. Somehow he knew he must not give up that lamp.  
                
                “Let me up first," said Aladdin.  "Then will I give you the lamp.”
                
                 
                
                Aladdin felt a chill in the air.  Something was wrong.
                
                 
                
                The magician was furious. He fell into a rage and barked out more magical words.  The giant white quartz crystal rose up, hovered over the hole and landed. All went dark below. Aladdin was trapped!
                
                For two days, Aladdin despaired.  “Why didn’t I just hand over this old lamp?  Who cares about it, anyway?  Whatever might have come of it, it couldn’t have been worse than this!  What was I thinking?”
                
                Rubbing the lamp, he moaned, “Oh, how I wish I could get out of here!”
                
                At once, a huge Genie rose up into the air.  “You are my master!” boomed the Genie. “Was that your first wish - to get out of this cave?  Three wishes are yours to command.”

                Aladdin’s mouth fell open, amazed. He mumbled yes, of course!  More than anything he wanted to get out of the cave and go home!  The very next moment, Aladdin was outside his own home, still holding the lamp and with all his jewel-fruits in his vest pockets.  
                
                His mother could not believe the tale her son told her.  “Magic lamp?” she laughed. “That old thing?” She took the lamp, grabbed a rag, and started to clean it.  “If there were really a Genie in this old lamp, I would say to it, ‘Genie, make a feast for my son and me, and serve it on plates of gold!’”
                
                You can imagine the mother’s surprise!  The Genie rose up out of the lamp, and a feast fit for a king weighed down her kitchen table, on plates of glimmering gold.

                Mother and son enjoyed a feast like no other.  Then the mother washed and sold the gold plates, and bought necessary things to live.  From then on, Aladdin and his mother lived well.
                
                One day, Aladdin thought to himself, “Why think small?  With my jewel-fruits, I could marry the princess and become the prince of this land!”
                
                His mother laughed.  “You can’t just go to a palace with some fine gifts and expect to marry the princess!”  But Aladdin urged her to try. They wrapped some of the jewel-fruits in silk cloth, and the mother went to the palace.
                
                The guards stopped her at once.  But as she insisted she had something very valuable for the Sultan, they let her in.
                
                 
                
                They wrapped some of the jewel-fruits in silk cloth.
                
                 
                
                Said the Sultan, “What have you brought me in those silk rags?”
                
                She showed him the jewel-fruits.  The Sultan was impressed. “But if your son is as worthy of my daughter as you say, he must bring me 40 golden trays of the same gems, carried in by servants.”
                
                The mother went home and told her son the Sultan’s demand.  “It's no problem,” said Aladdin. “Call for the Genie and make your second wish.” And so his mother rubbed the lamp and made her second wish.  Before long, she was at the steps of the Sultan’s palace with 40 golden trays of the jewel-fruits, carried in by as many servants.
                
                The Sultan was pleased.  “But you cannot think this is enough to win the hand of my daughter!” he said. “To truly win my favor, your son must build a golden palace for he and my daughter to live.”
                
                The Mother brought back this news, too.  So for her third wish, the Mother asked the Genie to create a golden palace.  The next morning, right outside the Sultan’s bedroom, appeared a huge golden palace, gleaming in the sun.

                Meanwhile back at Aladdin’s home, his Mother said, “It is time for you to go, my son, to meet your princess.”  Her wishes spent, she gave him the lamp.
                
                The next morning, the Sultan called for his daughter.  “Look at this palace!” he said, pointing out the window.  “This is the husband for you!”
                
                “What do you mean, Father?” said his daughter.  “What do you know about this man? Have you ever met him?”
                
                “What’s there to know?” said the Sultan.  “He can make a golden palace appear overnight.  He’s even more powerful than my royal adviser, the Vizier.”
                
                 
                
                “What’s there to know?” said the Sultan. "He can make a golden palace appear overnight."
                
                 
                
                 “Yesterday, your Vizier was most powerful man in the kingdom," said his daughter, "and I was to marry him.  Today, this stranger is the most powerful one and I’m to marry him. Why do you think it matters to me who’s the most powerful?”

                “It matters to ME!” said the Sultan.  In a lower voice he said, “Daughter, you’re just excited to get such a fine husband.”
                
                “I can’t believe this!” The princess threw her arms up in despair, and she left.
                
                In her dressing room, the princess groaned.  To Nadia, her lady-in-waiting, she said, “My father is determined to marry me off, no matter what!”
                
                 “But Madam,” said Nadia, “isn’t this wonderful stranger an excellent match for you?”
                
                The princess sighed.  She looked at her lady-in-waiting.  “You don’t know how lucky you are,” she said. “I would rather live your life than be handed off in this way.”
                
                “And I would rather live yours,” said Nadia.  The two of them stared at each other for a couple of moments.  They were about the same height, with the same color hair. With all the scarves maidens like them wore…
                
                “Let’s do it!” they said together.  And the two of them changed clothes.
                
                Just then, Aladdin was riding to the Sultan’s palace on a white horse, ready to meet his bride.  The Sultan warmly greeted him.
                
                 
                
                “Let’s do it!” they said together.
                
                 
                
                “Stay here in my palace until the preparations for your wedding are complete,” he said.  Aladdin could not meet the princess until their wedding day. He caught a glimpse of Nadia from a distance, covered in scarves, thinking she was the true princess.  Aladdin, the Sultan, and everyone else in the palace waited with growing excitement for the wedding day.
                
                Except for one person.  The uncle-magician who had left Aladdin trapped in the cave was also the Sultan’s Vizier.

                He had recognized Aladdin at once.  He knew there could be only one reason the young man could present all this magic to the Sultan. Aladdin must have escaped from the cave, and with the lamp!  
                
                “I will get my revenge!” swore the Vizier.   “If anyone is to have the lamp, it is ME!” By his magic, he could tell where Aladdin had hidden the lamp.  While Aladdin was sleeping, the Vizier crept in and took it.
                
                 
                
                “If anyone is to have the lamp, it is ME!"
                
                 
                
                In a quiet place, the Vizier made his first wish: “Genie, do as I say.  I want you to take Aladdin’s palace to a faraway place in the desert that no one can find!”
                
                What the Vizier did not know was at that very moment, Nadia was exploring Aladdin’s palace.  And there is something else the Vizier did not know. The Genie thought the Vizier had commanded to be taken away also, along with the palace.  So the Genie sent the Vizier, the golden palace, and Nadia inside it, all together to the faraway place in the desert. 
                
                The next morning, the Sultan awoke and saw nothing outside his bedroom window where Aladdin’s palace had stood the day before.  The next moment his servants rushed in, announcing that the princess had disappeared. Furious, he called for Aladdin.
                
                “What have you done?” he yelled in a rage.  “Because of your magic tricks I have lost my daughter!  You must bring her back to me in three days or it will cost you your head!” 
                
                 
                
                "What have you done?" he yelled in a rage.
                
                 
                
                Aladdin thought he would simply use his second wish and the Genie would bring back the princess and the castle too. But his magic lamp was gone - he looked everywhere! 
                
                In despair, Aladdin could do nothing but to leave the Sultan’s palace on the white horse he had rode in on. Sadly, he rode from town to town but no one knew anything about a palace that had appeared overnight, no to mention one with a princess inside.  
                
                You may wonder, where was the true princess all this time? Dressed as a servant girl, she had crept out of the palace the very day she had switched clothes with Nadia.  Down to the marketplace she had gone, and there she met an aging merchant. The old merchant told her he was tired from riding so many years from town to town, selling his potions and perfumes. 
                
                The princess was dressed humbly, yet she still carried herself like royalty. She gained the confidence of the old merchant, and when she offered to ride his camel train for him and share what she earned, he was delighted.  That is how our princess found herself up clop-clopping through the desert, selling potions and perfumes from town to town.

                Two days passed. Aladdin was no closer to finding his lost palace than he had been before he left the Sultan.  Crouched in front of his tent, Aladdin held his head in his hands.  
                
                “Why the sad face?” The princess was riding by and she stopped her camel train.  “Perhaps a potion will make you feel better.”
                
                 
                
                "Why the sad face?"
                
                 
                
                 “No, thank you,” said Aladdin.  “The only thing that could help is if I could bring back a princess and find my lost palace.  You see, my palace vanished overnight to a place I know not where. The princess was probably inside it. Oh, this is an impossible task!”
                
                “Maybe not,” said the princess. “In my travels, I heard of a palace in the desert that appeared out of nowhere, not long ago.”
                
                “Really?” said Aladdin.  He looked up. “Do you know where?”
                
                “I think so.  I could take you there.  If we left now, we could get there by morning.”
                
                “I’d be so grateful!” said Aladdin.  He had left all the jewel-fruits with his Mother except one.  This he offered to the camel-rider as payment.
                
                “Oh, keep it,” said she with a wave of her hand.  “It’s no trouble. Bring your horse to ride alongside my camel.”
                
                 
                
                “Really?” said Aladdin.  He looked up. “Do you know where?”
                
                 
                
                Riding through the night, the two of them spoke of many things.  Aladdin marveled at the young lady’s easy manner and generous spirit.  He somehow knew she could be trusted. Before long, he told her his story of how he had discovered the magic lamp in the cave and how it had been stolen from him, along with the palace.  
                
                As the morning’s light brightened, they were riding between two very tall walls of rock, rose-colored they were, with thin bands of white and blue.  Suddenly the rock walls ended, and they arrived at a clearing.
                
                “Look!” said the princess, pointing ahead.  “Is that it?”

                “It is!” Aladdin cried out with joy, recognizing his palace.  “I hope the princess is still in there!" he said.  "Though without my lamp, I have no way to get them both back in time.”
                
                Just then Nadia, who had been carried away along with the palace as you no doubt remember, was looking out the window at the new guests.  To her surprise, she recognized the rider of the camel train as none other than her beloved former mistress. She waved at them both to come to the front door.
                
                The servants let in the guests. Nadia took them to the drawing room and shut the door. She said, “Mistress!  How glad I am to see you!”
                
                “I'm glad to see you too, Nadia.”
                
                Aladdin was amazed. “You two know each other?”
                
                But the princess only said to Nadia, “Tell me, how do you find being a princess?” 
                
                 
                
                Aladdin was amazed.  “You two know each other?”
                
                 
                
                 “At first, the gowns were marvelous,” she said.  “Everything I dreamed of! And I liked well enough all the attention I got.  But when I was carried away with this palace, the Vizier came with it, too.  For the last two days he has done nothing but fly about in a rage and smash things. He locked me up in here!”
                
                “That’s terrible!” said the princess.
                
                “There’s more,” said Nadia.  “He said with his lamp, that tomorrow we’ll return to the Sultan’s land and I will have to marry him!”  
                
                “He said…with his lamp?” Aladdin and the princess looked at each other.
                
                The princess turned to Nadia. “Wait a minute!  I have a plan.” 
                
                 
                
                The princess turned to Nadia.  “Wait a minute! I have a plan.”
                
                 
                
                The princess gave Nadia one of the sleeping potions in her stock.  She told Nadia that when the Vizier returned that night, she must pour the sleeping potion into his wine.  He would fall into a sleep so deep that he would not be awakened by any noise. That is what she did.  When the wicked man was snoring, Nadia, the princess, and Aladdin searched everywhere for the magic lamp. At last they found it!  
                
                The lamp in his hands again, Aladdin said, “Now I can make a second wish. I am going to wish for this castle and everyone in it to go back to the Sultan’s kingdom – except for the Vizier.”
                
                “Wait!” said the princess.  "Leave me behind, too.” 
                
                Aladdin urged her to come with him, but the princess would have none of it. She liked too well the life of freedom she led.  Aladdin did not like at all that she would be left behind with the Vizier. But she assured him the Vizier would not awaken for hours, and she would have plenty of time to get far away.  
                
                So Aladdin rubbed the lamp and stated his wish to the Genie.

                In a whoosh, Aladdin, the palace and Nadia were all transported back to the very spot where the palace had stood before.
                
                The Sultan was delighted to have his daughter back, or you might say, the young woman he believed to be his daughter, covered as she was in scarves.  “We will hold the wedding in three days!” the Sultan said to Aladdin.
                
                Yet a sadness was growing in Aladdin’s heart.  Nadia was indeed a nice young woman, and pleasant to look at, too.  But there was something about that woman who rode the camel train, selling perfumes and potions.  He could not get out of his mind the sound of her laugh, her clever mind, and the comfort of her company.  At last, he rubbed the lamp.
                
                “Master,” said the Genie, “Is it mountains of jewels you want for your third wish, power over all the neighboring lands, or the strength of 100 men?”
                
                 
                
                But there was something about that woman who rode the camel train.
                
                 
                
                “None of that,” said Aladdin.  “I wish you to take me to that young woman I met, the camel rider, the seller of perfumes and potions.”
                
                “But Master, this is your third and last wish!” said the Genie.  “What if you were to offer this woman your heart, and she didn’t choose you back?  You’ll miss your chance to marry the Sultan’s daughter and become a prince.” 
                
                “I don’t care!” said Aladdin. “I must share with her what is in my heart.  Whatever comes of it, so be it.”
                
                 
                
                “But Master, this is your third and last wish!” said the Genie.
                
                 
                
                So Aladdin made his third and last wish and was taken to the true princess.  In her travels, she was not all that far from the Sultan’s land, as it turns out.  Aladdin shared his true feelings to her and she returned the same feelings.

                She told him her story – that she had been born a princess but now was happier living as a traveling merchant.  Aladdin said he wanted nothing better than to spend the rest of his days with her by his side. And so they agreed to marry and together ride the camel train, selling potions and perfumes from town to town.  
                
                Then – such surprising news!  Aladdin and the princess learned that the Sultan had suddenly died.  Said Aladdin to his new bride, “Since your father is gone, would you return now to your father’s palace?  We could rule the kingdom together, side by side.”
                
                As a last goodbye to their life on the camel train, Aladdin and the princess mixed a very special magical potion.  In a cloud of smoke, a magic carpet appeared!  And on this magic carpet Aladdin and the princess flew back to the palace.

                
                Nadia was very pleased to see them. She gladly stepped down to serve again as lady-in-waiting to the princess. 
                
                For the rest of their lives, Aladdin and the princess ruled the kingdom wisely and well.  And they lived happily ever after, as should you.

              In all the land, none was better with a bow and arrow than Robin Hood.  He lived with his band of Merry Men in Sherwood Forest.  That was the King's woods where King John kept his royal deer.

A few years before, King Richard had ruled the land.  This King let the poor come into Sherwood Forest to hunt the deer to feed their families. But the time had come for King Richard and his army to leave England.  And then King John stepped up to the throne.

"Bad King John," as this king would become known by, did not want anyone to come into Sherwood Forest.  Why should he - when he wanted to be able to hunt the royal deer whever he wanted?  From then on, he made it known throughout the land that anyone seen hunting in Sherwood Forest would be grabbed at once and thrown into prison.
Robin Hood did not like that one bit.  That is why he had moved into Sherwood Forest.  He dressed in green from cap to boots so the trees of Sherwood Forest could hide him as he hunted the King’s deer. Other brave men came into Sherwood Forest, too.  One by one they joined Robin Hood and became his Merry Men.

Robin Hood and his Merry Men would hide when rich nobles and dukes passed through the woods.  Then all at once, they would jump out and rob those rich men. Then he would give the money to the poor.

But the rich men who were robbed were not happy about it!  They told Bad King John what was going on in Sherwood Forest. "Something must be done!" they roared.  The King put the Sheriff of Nottingham in charge of Sherwood Forest. It would be his job to catch Robin Hood - once and for all!

But the man in green was too quick.  His Merry Men would warn him each time they saw the Sheriff of Nottingham or one of his guards in the woods, and Robin Hood would escape or hide.

So the Sheriff came up with a new plan.  “I will call for a great contest,” he said, “to find out who is the best in the land with a bow and arrow. The winner will go home with a Golden Arrow.”

The Sheriff said in a low voice, “If I know Robin Hood, he will not be able to stay away from such a contest. And when he comes, we will catch him!”

“Robin Hood, don’t go to the contest!” said Little John.  Of all the Merry Men, Robin Hood trusted Little John the most. “Can't you see this is a trap? When they see you, they will grab you.”

Robin Hood said nothing.  In his heart, he wanted to go.

On the day of the contest, ten fine bowmen lined up.  The round target was so far away it was almost impossible to see its black and red circles.  One by one, each young man shot his best arrow. Most of them missed.  Some landed on the target, but none came close to the center.

The Sheriff turned to one of his guards.  “Do you see him? Is he here?”

“No, Sire.  Robin Hood has red hair.  None of the ones who are shooting has red hair.”

“That wimp!” said the Sheriff.  “He fears me!  He didn't have the guts to come.”

Two bowmen were left.  The first was William, the Sheriff's man.  With care, William, took aim.  His arrow landed at the very center of the target - a bull’s eye!  The crowd cheered for William.

It was time for the last bowman.  He too, took careful aim, and his arrow also sailed through the air.  It landed right through William's bull’s eye arrow, cutting it in half!  In a flash, the bowman let go of two more arrows. Each one flew to where the Sheriff sat, pinning him to his seat, one arrow on each side!  

The Sheriff did not know what was going on.  Then the man in green pulled off his disguise and threw it on the ground.  

“Get him, you fools!” shouted the Sheriff.  “It's Robin Hood!”

 




 

But our hero jumped over the wall to a horse waiting for him.  He was gone - he had escaped!

The end.
